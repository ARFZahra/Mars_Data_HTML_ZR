# Mars_Data_HTML_ZR
For Challenge 11, we utilized our knowledge of HTML elements, IDs, and class attributes to extract information using both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. The following technical products were completed:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data from a table.
